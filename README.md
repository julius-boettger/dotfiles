# [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration and other dotfiles

### Credit
- My [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) config is based on the "rainbow" theme of [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats), which I then modified to fit my taste and needs
- My wallpaper is a modified version of `nix-wallpaper-nineish-dark-gray` of [nixos-artwork](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-artwork)
